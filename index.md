Welcome to the website for the workshop _Towards a theory of typical-case algorithmic hardness_, which will take place from the 27/01/2025 to the 7/02/2025 at the Les Houches Physics School in the French alps.

The workshop theme will be typical-case algorithmic hardness, with a special focus on creating bridges between the complementary approaches of theoretical computer science and statistical physics, identifying the crucial open question in the field and linking rigorous and non-rigorous methods.

We will have a set of in-depth lectures, many seminars covering state-of-the-art advances, a poster session, discussion time, and many occasions to explore the amazing surroundings of the school.
